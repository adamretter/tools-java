tools-java
==========

XML tools for Java.  Independent on any specific processor.  Main
focus is helping writing extensions.

For now, it is mainly a data model for abstracting XML nodes in Java.
It has been retro-fitted from other existing projects for extension
functions in Java (for Saxon, eXist and QuizX).  The model is still
ad-hoc now, and its design is not stable (nor good as far as I am
concerned).  The goal is to refactor it in successive iterations,
please do not use it yet.
